# üè® Smart Hotel Management System

A modern full-stack hotel booking and management application built with **Spring Boot** (Java backend) and **React.js** (frontend with Tailwind CSS & pnpm).

---

## üöÄ Overview

This system allows:

* Guests to search and book hotel rooms.
* **Email Notifications**: Automated emails sent for booking confirmations and new user reviews.
* **Hotels Displayed by Rating**: Hotels on the landing page are ordered by their average customer rating (highest first).
* **Managers** to manage rooms, room availability, and room images for their assigned hotels.
* **Admins** to manage hotels, add new managers, and assign managers to specific hotels.
* Basic **mock payment simulation** without third-party integration.

## üîß Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Smart Hotel Management System up and running on your local machine.

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd hotelmanagement_backend
    ```

2.  **Update `application.properties`:**

    Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file and configure your database connection, server port, and **email service details**:

    ```properties
    server.port=8095

    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hotel_db
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

    # Email Configuration (Example for Gmail SMTP)
    spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
    spring.mail.port=587
    spring.mail.username=your-email@gmail.com
    spring.mail.password=your-email-password # Use app-specific password if 2FA is on
    spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
    spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
    # For less secure app access (not recommended for production):
    # spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.ssl.trust=smtp.gmail.com
    ```

    * **`server.port`**: The port where your Spring Boot backend will run.
    * **`spring.datasource.url`**: Your MySQL database connection URL. Make sure `hotel_db` exists or will be created by Hibernate.
    * **`spring.datasource.username`**: Your MySQL username.
    * **`spring.datasource.password`**: Your MySQL password.
    * **`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto`**: Set to `update` to allow Hibernate to manage schema updates.
    * **Email Configuration**: **Crucial for email features.** Replace `your-email@gmail.com` and `your-email-password` with your actual email credentials. If using Gmail with 2-Factor Authentication, you'll need to generate an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) for this purpose.

3.  **Run the Spring Boot application:**

    You can run the backend using Maven:

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    The backend server will start and be accessible at `http://localhost:8095`.

### üåê Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend folder:**

    ```bash
    cd hotelmanagement_frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Install all required Node.js packages using pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

    This command will install the following key dependencies:
    * `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.
    * `react-toastify` and `react-hot-toast` for notifications.
    * `axios` for making HTTP requests.
    * `react-datepicker` for date input.
    * `jwt-decode` for decoding JSON Web Tokens.
    * `uuid` for generating unique IDs.
    * `framer-motion` for animations.
    * `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` and `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` for icons.

3.  **Start development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    The frontend development server will start, typically running at:

    üìå **Runs at: `http://localhost:5173`**

    **Important:** Ensure your React API calls are configured to hit the backend at `http://localhost:8095`. You might need to check your frontend's environment configuration or API utility files to confirm this.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the application through your web browser.
